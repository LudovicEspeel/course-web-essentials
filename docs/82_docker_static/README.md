## Prepare your project for deployment

To be able to deploy our website on the VM, we need to prepare it.

### Create a GitHub repository for deployment

Steps to take if you **already have a repository** (e.g. created via the assignment invitation link on Toledo) such as:
```
https://github.com/vives-brugge-web-essentials-20<xx>-20<yy>/project-1-<YourGitHubName>.git

git@github.com:vives-brugge-web-essentials-20<xx>-20<yy>/project-1-<YourGitHubName>.git
```

1. Rework your folder structure: create below root folder `<project>` the subfolder `website`.
   * In your case, `<project>` will be something like `<project-1-YourGitHubName>`.
2. Put all your files in this subfolder. If needed, rename the HTML file to `index.html` to make it easier to access your website.
3. Make a first push.

Steps to take if you **do NOT have a repository yet and create everything from scratch**:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Create a local folder `<project>` with a subfolder `website`.
3. Put all your files in this subfolder. If needed, rename the HTML file to `index.html` to make it easier to access your website.
4. Open the folder `<project>` in Visual Code and open a terminal.
5. Make it a git repository by typing `git init`
6. Add the remote GitHub repository by typing `git remote add origin git@github.com:yourGitHubUsername/repositoryname.git` (the last part is your SSH link from your GitHub repository).
7. Make a first push.

### Create a docker-compose file

We will be deploying our website in a docker container, so the first thing we need to do is make a docker-compose file containing the information of how to deploy this project.

Create a file `docker-compose.yml` in the root folder  `<project>` with the following content:

``` yaml
version: '3'
services:
  httpd:
    image: httpd:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
    restart: always
```
* `version: '3'` specifies that Docker Compose version 3 is being used. This setting seems to be optional with newer Docker versions ...
* `httpd:` refers to the Apache HTTP Server, which is defined here as a service.
* `services:` indicates that the following configuration describes the services to be deployed by Docker Compose.
* `volumes:` maps a folder on the host machine to a folder inside the container. Here, `./website` (relative to the location of the `docker-compose.yml` file) is mapped to `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` inside the container, which is Apache's default webroot.
* `restart: always` instructs Docker to always try to restart this service unless it was explicitly stopped by an administrator.
* `ports:`: defines the mapping between the host machine's port (external) and the container's port (internal). In this case, port 80 on the host is mapped to port 80 inside the container.

Now the preperation is ready, **push now everything to GitHub**.

## Clone and deploy your project in the VM

1. Open a terminal and connect to your VM by the ssh command.
2. Now you need to clone your docker repo, by using the https link of your GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/vives-brugge-web-essentials-20<xx>-20<yy>/project-1-<YourGitHubName>.git` (If you've already cloned the repository before, just use `git pull`).
3. Go to your folder `<project>`
   * If you want to see the subfolders and files below a folder, use the command `ls`
   * Go to a subfolder using the command `cd <folder name>`
4. The only thing left to do is deploying your website by starting the docker container.
   * To start: `docker compose up -d`
   * To stop: `docker compose down`
   * To view logs: `docker compose ps`
   * To view a list of the containers: `docker compose ls`

Now everyone connected to the `devbit` network can browse to your website via `http://<ip address>`.
