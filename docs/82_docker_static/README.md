## Prepare your project for deployment

To be able to deploy our website on the VM we need to prepare it.

Please check if all your URL's are relative (HTML and CSS)

### Create a GitHub repository for deployment

* create a new repository on github
* create a local folder `<projectname>` with a subfolder `website`
* make a copy of your project to the folder `website`
* open the folder `<projectname>` in Visual Code and open a terminal
* make it a git repository by typing `git init`.
* add the remote GitHub repository by typing `git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/repositoryname.git` (the last part is your SSH link from your GitHub repository)
* make a first push 

### Create a docker-compose file

We will be deploying our website in a docker container, so the first thing we need to do is make a docker-compose file containing the information of how to deploy this project.

Create a file `docker-compose.yml` in the folder  `<projectname>` with the following content:

``` yaml
version: '3'
services:
  httpd:
    image: httpd:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
    restart: always
```
* `version: '3'` : This instructs Docker Compose that weâ€™re using version 3 of the tool.
* `httpd:` : The Apache HTTP Server
* `services:` : This will instruct Docker Compose that what follows will be the services to deploy.
* `restart: allways` : We instruct Docker to always retry to start this service unless it was stopped by the admin.
* `ports:` : We define both the external and internal ports to use for the database.

Now the preperation is ready and you can **push everyting the GitHub**.

## Clone and deploy your project

### Making a remote connection to your VM

We use the extension `ssh remote` in Visual Code to make a remote connection to your VM.

Start using a remote window by pressing the green button on the bottom left:
![Open a remote window](./images/remote-indicator.png)

Now select `Connect to Host` and type `student@<Ip adress of your VM>`

![Connect to host](./images/connecttohost.png)

Now select `Linux` as the platform:

![Connect to host](./images/platform.png)

### Clone your repository on your VM

Now you need to clone your docker repo, by using the https link of your GitHub repository.

```bash
git clone <https link repo>
```

### Deploy your website on your VM

The only thing left to do is deploying your website by starting the docker container.

* To start : `docker compose up -d`
* To stop : `docker compose down`
* To view logs : `docker compose ps`
* To view a list of the containers : `docker compose ls`

Now everyone connected to the `devbit` network can acces your website through it's IP adress.
