# Databases

To be able to store, retrieve, edit or delete data we will use a database.
To be able to do that we need a database service, in this course we will focus on relational databases **MySQL** and **MariaDB**.

A relational database stores data in the form of tables containing rows and columns. It ensures referential integrity between the rows of a table and interprets queries to fetch information from the database. One database can contain several tables each existing of rows and columns (fixed structure).

## MySQL

MySQL is a free, open-source, relational database management system (RDBMS) created by MySQL AB for web application development. In most cases, MySQL works alongside PHP, Apache web servers, and Linux distributions. It’s modifiable using the Structured Query Language (SQL).

## MariaDB

MariaDB is a fork of MySQL. The developers built the RDBMS to preserve MySQL’s structure and features. They feared that the system’s acquisition by Oracle – the corporation behind the Oracle Database, which was MySQL’s biggest competitor at the time ‒ would jeopardize the database.

MariaDB’s developers make sure that each release is compatible with the corresponding version of MySQL. MariaDB not only adopts MySQL’s data and table definition files but also uses identical client protocols, client APIs, ports, and sockets. The goal is to let MySQL users switch to MariaDB hassle-free.

Much like MySQL, MariaDB is modifiable using SQL statements.
